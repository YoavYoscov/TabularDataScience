## Note regarding requirements:
> This final project (in the 'FinalResearchProject' folder) does not use any non-ordinary libraries, and therefore there is no 'requirements.txt' file (the 'requirements.txt' file in the main folder is related to submissions #1 and #2).<br>

In the final project guidelines, we were instructed to include a 'requirements.txt' file only <b>"if you use any non-ordinary libraries (i.e., that we didn't use in class)"</b>; since the main theme of my proposed solution is introducing <u>new</u> methods and algorithms rather than using the existing ones, and as the ideas, methods and concepts which are part of my suggested solution are inspired by material learned in class (as will be detailed below), I have not used libraries which were not used in class. Namely, the libraries <i>'pandas'</i>, <i>'numpy'</i>, <i>'seaborn'</i>, <i>'matplotlib'</i> were used during lecture #1 of the course, and <i>'scipy'</i> library was used during lecture #2 of the course (regarding goodness of fit). In addition, the 'xgboost' library was also discussed in class, and was specifically advised to use since the first submission in the course.
